## About

This is my coursework for Build a Modern Computer From First Principles: From Nand to Tetris.

Nand2Tetris is a self-directed, project-oriented online course whose aim is to build a computer capable of running Tetris starting from nothing but the humble NAND gate.

## Notable

While many of the chips and programs implemented here are rather trivial, there are a few that are highly instructive. These are:

### [ALU.hdl](https://github.com/m-cat/nand2tetris/blob/master/project2/ALU.hdl)

The Arithmetic Logic Unit.

### [PC.hdl](https://github.com/m-cat/nand2tetris/blob/master/project3/PC.hdl)

The Program Counter - probably the hardest assignment.

### [Fill.asm](https://github.com/m-cat/nand2tetris/blob/master/project4/Fill.asm)

An example assembly program, showcasing our assembly language and machine architecture.
